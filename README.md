**This is a work-in-progress and not ready for any kind of use!**

WIO is a JavaScript library that provides access to files on cloud storage services, with offline caching, through a single consistent API.

WIO adapters are plugins that implement individual cloud services (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox, GitHub, etc.), local caching (e.g. LocalStorage, IndexedDB, etc.) or manipulate files (e.g. encryption).
